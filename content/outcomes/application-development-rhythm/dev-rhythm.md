This article is the fifth and final in a five-part series.

To best visualize what the developer workflow looks like in practice,
you can:

- [Watch the video, coming soon](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal/issues/1097).
- [Run through the Developer Flow Workshop](../../../workshops/dev-workflow)

Both will demonstrate a daily developer's flow using TDD and
Continuous Integration practices,
along with techniques such as *Red/Green/Refactor*, *Mikado Method*
and *Private Branching*.
